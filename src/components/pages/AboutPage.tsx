              <p>
                I am Wenzi Li, a Toronto based textile artist holds MFA in
                Interdisciplinary Masterâ€™s in Art, Media and Design Program at
                OCAD University. I identify and position my textile work in a
                historical and contemporary context as a Chinese female living
                in Toronto immersed by both eastern and western cultures to
                explore my Asian identity in this multi-culture community. My
                silk art were developing from my unique textile design method
                that derived from the motifs of traditional Chinese needlework.
